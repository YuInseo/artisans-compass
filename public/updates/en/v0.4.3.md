# Update Notice (v0.4.3)
- **Date**: 2026-02-26
- **Description**:

- Completely resolved the issue where the empty space in the Calendar view toolbar could not be used to drag the application window by explicitly applying the drag region.
- Fixed the Goal Setting modal's input areas appearing pitch black and indistinguishable against the dark background. Implemented a clean semi-transparent background with distinct borders for better visibility.
