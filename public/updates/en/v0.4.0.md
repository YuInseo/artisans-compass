# Update Notice (v0.4.0)
- **Date**: 2026-02-23
- **Description**: 
  - Widget Opacity Fix: We fixed a couple of bugs with the widget opacity slider where it only affected the Daily panel's solid color. Now, the internal elements properly fade with the widget's opacity setting, and the App Layout respects the transparent background down to the desktop wallpaper.
  - Widget Text Alignment: Refined the visual alignment of text when left-aligned on the Timer Widget for a more natural look.
  - White Flash Prevention: Further optimized the initial rendering sequence so the app doesn't flash bright white before the dark/light theme is properly applied.
