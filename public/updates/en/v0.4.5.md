# Update Notice (v0.4.5)
- **Date**: 2026-02-26
- **Description**: 
  - **New "Add Pomodoro Task" Modal**: Removed the redundant inline text input at the bottom of the Pomodoro sidebar, replacing it with a new "+" button that triggers a dedicated modal supporting more options (Icons, Timer Modes like Pomodoro vs Stopwatch, and custom durations).
  - **Detailed Task View**: Clicking an item from the left Pomodoro task list now switches the right panel from a global overview to a detailed statistical view (Focus count, total time, and a weekly layout) specific to that task.
  - **UI/UX Polishing**: 
    - Added a `backdrop-blur` effect with adjusted opacity to all modal dialogs, drastically improving visibility and depth.
    - Removed unused 'In Progress' and 'Archived' status toggle buttons from the Pomodoro top header to declutter the area.
    - Resolved a React rendering bug ("Rendered fewer hooks than expected") caused by conditional hook calls.
