# Update Notice (v0.4.4)
- **Date**: 2026-02-26
- **Description**: 
  - Fixed a bug causing the Timetable graph to inaccurately merge project sessions in the Daily Panel, stripping them of their assigned colors. Explicitly tracked project sessions are now firmly preserved under all conditions.
  - Completely removed the gray background from the left sidebar in the Settings modal, offering a much more natural and cohesive look.
  - Hid the "Color Theme" dropdown in the Settings menu when the application is in Light Mode.
