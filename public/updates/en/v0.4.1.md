# Update Notice (v0.4.1)
- **Date**: 2026-02-26
- **Description**:

## 0.4.1 (Quotes & Reminders UI Update)
- Upgraded the UI for the Custom Quotes (`QuoteManager`) and Reminders (`ReminderManager`) to a more premium design (glassmorphism effect, optimized spacing, better element placement).


## 0.4.1 (Quotes & Reminders Edit)
- Added an edit feature to Custom Quotes (`QuoteManager`) and Reminders (`ReminderManager`). You can now conveniently edit the text of existing items directly inline and save it.
- Further increased the padding in the input fields and list items to completely fixed the issue where the text was cut off on the left side of the modal.
- Fixed a layout issue where the entire `Settings Modal` content was slightly clipped on the left by adjusting the padding of the scrolling area container.
- Removed the inline editing functionality for quotes directly within the widget and dashboard view.
- Improved the logic so that your "Custom Quotes" will now appear prioritized over the default quotes in both the widget and the morning Inspiration Modal.


## 0.4.1 (Quotes & Reminders Edit)
- Added a `Show Routines` ON/OFF toggle in the Timetable settings popover located in the Widget and Dashboard view, allowing users to show or hide their repetitive routines.
- This setting is linked to the global AppSettings and will instantly reflect in the rendered daily graph (`TimeTableGraph`).


## 0.4.1 (Quotes & Reminders Edit)
- Significantly reduced the heavy rendering lag (stuttering) that occurred when transitioning from Widget Mode back to General Mode.
- Removed a rendering bottleneck by changing the dynamic async theme imports to static synchronous imports.
- Reordered the IPC communication so that the OS window expands first, followed by a 50ms delay before rendering the heavy main UI, preventing window-resize and React DOM updates from clashing.


## 0.4.1 (Quotes & Reminders Edit)
- Polished the spacing between the 'Daily Quest' and 'Goal Setting' buttons at the bottom of the sidebar.
- Grouped both buttons into a single flex container with a consistent gap (`gap-2`), giving the UI a cleaner and more cohesive look.


### ✨ Enhancement: Applied i18n to 'New task...'
- Modified the hardcoded "New task..." text in `TodoItem` and `ClosingRitualModal` to be i18n compatible using `react-i18next`.
- Added the `"newTask"` key to the `dashboard` section in `ko.json`, `en.json`, and `ja.json`.
- Resolved a lint error in `ClosingRitualModal` by renaming the variable `t` to `todo` to prevent naming collisions with the translation function `t`.


### 🐛 Bug Fix: Project Search Bar Behavior Improvement
- **Search Bar Text Update:** Fixed the search input to correctly display the selected project's name when an item is clicked from the project list.
- **Search Bar Dropdown Bug Fix:** Resolved an issue where the dropdown menu failed to appear when clicking the search bar after a project was already selected. This was fixed by clearing the input focus (`blur()`) immediately after a selection, ensuring the dropdown opens correctly on click (`onClick`), and auto-selecting the full text upon focus (`select()`).


Applied First Launch Time Display and Recording (1)
- Recorded the app's first launch time (using the `firstOpenedAt` field upon initial log creation) and visually displayed it on the timeline chart (`TimeTableGraph`).
- Enhanced the logic to ensure the first launch time is safely preserved without being lost within the Daily Archive modal and Daily Panel.
- Reflected the passing of relevant props across major UI components (`DailyArchiveView`, `ClosingRitualModal`, `DailyArchiveModal`, etc.).


- Fixed a bug where opening the General Work panel would briefly create two empty task items due to React StrictMode's double effect execution.
- Added multilingual text (Korean, English, Japanese) for the `lockFutureDates` feature, which restricts scheduling outside the preset period.


- Added a "Show First Launch Time" toggle option to the timetable settings popover.
- Applied internationalization (i18n) translations for Korean, English, and Japanese to support the new setting.
- Updated the timetable visualization component (`TimeTableGraph`) to dynamically show or hide the first launch indicator based on this setting.


- Removed the "Switch to Weekly View" button (calendar icon) from the right side of the timetable header.


- Changed the view options (settings) icon in the Weekly View header from a gear to a sliders icon (`Settings2`).


- Applied internationalization (i18n) to the "View Options" dropdown menu items ("View Options", "Show App Usage") in the Weekly View.


- Added a "Show Daily Quote" toggle option (`enableQuotes`) in General Settings to control the visibility of the inspiration dialog.


- Added the 'Show First Launch Time' toggle to the global settings (Timetable > Timeline tab) as well, improving accessibility outside of the Weekly View popover.
