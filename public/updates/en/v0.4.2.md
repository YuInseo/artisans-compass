# Update Notice (v0.4.2)
- **Date**: 2026-02-26
- **Description**:

- Fixed the draggability of the application window while in the Calendar/Weekly view by targeting the `-webkit-app-region` properties to specific interactive elements instead of the whole toolbar.
- Fixed a visual glitch in the Goal Setting modal where the background was partially transparent leading to poor readability; the text areas have been updated to seamlessly match the default app theme (`bg-muted` variants with theme borders).
