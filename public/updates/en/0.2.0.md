# Update Notice (v0.2.0)
- **Date**: 2026-02-10
- **Description**:

## 1. Fixed Window Positioning Bug
- **Issue**: The window would jump to the wrong monitor when switching back from widget mode to normal mode.
- **Fix**: Improved logic in `electron/main.ts` using `screen.getDisplayMatching()` to accurately detect the current display of the widget and restore the window to the center of that specific screen.

## 2. Theme Settings Overhaul (Theme Refactoring)
- **Goal**: Completely separate styles (theme + color) for the Main Window and the Widget.
- **Changes**:
    - `types.ts`: Added `widgetThemePreset` field to store widget-specific color presets.
    - `SettingsModal.tsx`: Clearly separated the "Appearance" tab into **Main Window** and **Widget** sections.
    - `DailyPanel.tsx`: Implemented logic to inject widget-specific colors (CSS variables) when entering widget mode, allowing for completely independent styling from the main theme.

## 3. Settings Sidebar Cleanup (UI Polish)
- **Request**: Remove "Custom Quotes" category and consolidate editor-related settings.
- **Changes**:
    - Removed the "Custom Quotes" menu from the settings sidebar.
    - Renamed the existing "Indentation Guides" menu to **"Editor Settings"**.
    - Grouped "Indentation Guides" and "Spell Check" options under this new section.

## 4. Maintenance
- **Translation (i18n)**: Added Korean (`ko.json`) translation keys for new features (Editor Settings, Widget Theme, etc.).
- **Type Error Fix**: Added `description` property to the `Theme` interface in `themes.ts` to resolve build errors and lint warnings.
